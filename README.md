# Eyes

### Description
This project demonstrates manipulation of DOM objects using continuous input from the built-in mouse movement event listener. The pupils of the eyes follow the user's cursor around and will move proportional to the distance of the cursor.

### How to Run
Currently is not built to be hosted. Simply open the index.html file locally with your browser or visit the [demo](https://maxohsawa.github.io/eyes).

### Roadmap of Future Improvements
Potentially may add more eyes and dimension to create a kaleidoscopic effect.
